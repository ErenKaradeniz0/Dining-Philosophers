# Dining Philosophers - C++ Visual Implementation

This is a visual implementation of the famous **Dining Philosophers Problem** using C++. The project demonstrates how multiple threads interact with shared resources (forks) and simulates philosophers sitting at a table, eating spaghetti while avoiding deadlock and resource contention. The program uses graphical representations to visualize the actions of philosophers.

## Features

- **Multithreading**: Simulates philosophers as threads, each requiring two forks to eat.
- **Graphics**: The project includes visual elements like philosophers, forks, and eating animations.
- **Sound Effects**: Background sounds and actions added for a more interactive experience.
- **Deadlock and Starvation Prevention**: The solution is designed to avoid deadlocks and starvation through synchronization mechanisms.
- **Philosopher Positions**: Philosophers are placed around the table, and their activities (thinking, eating) are visualized.

## Installation & Setup

To run this project on your local machine, make sure you have a C++ compiler that supports multi-threading.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dining-philosophers-cpp.git
